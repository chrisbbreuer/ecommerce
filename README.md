# FluxBucket â€” Challenge

This is a simple application that takes orders from listed products. It is built with Laravel, Vue 3 & Inertia. 

## ðŸš§ Prerequisites

Given this project requires only a default Laravel install, I have opted out of using Laravel Sail _(Docker)_ in favor of a more lightweight "setup" approach. This means you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Any PHP 8 version _(e.g. 8.2.2)_
- Composer 2 _(e.g. 2.5.3)_
- Node 16 or 18 _(project is nvm ready)_

## ðŸš€ Get Started

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository and run the commands below:

```bash
# Step 1: Run the setup script
#
# The setup command is a custom script that...
#
#   1. installs Laravel dependencies
#   2. copies the .env.example to .env
#   3. generates your local encryption key
#   4. creates the SQLite database file
#   5. runs the migrations
#   6. seeds the database with some dummy data
#   7. installs the "frontend dependencies"
#
# 
#
npm run setup

# Step 2: Serve the application
#
# Use the "artisan serve" command to 
# serve the app on port 8000.
#
php artisan serve --port 8000

# Optional: Install the frontend dependencies
#
# You may skip this step unless you prefer using `pnpm` 
# or `yarn`. _(I personally prefer pnpm the most ðŸ™‚)_
#
npm install

# Step 3: Run the frontend development server
#
# The frontend is built with Vue 3 & Inertia. 
# To run the development server, run the
# command below:
# 
npm run dev

nvm use 18 # you may use nvm to manage your Node version
```
